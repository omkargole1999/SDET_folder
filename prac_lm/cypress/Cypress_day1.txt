Manual testing :-
LearningMate :- Educatiion domain 

LearningMate product :- Frost

13th December :-
  The act of subjecing  to check in order to determine how well things work

Softwar testing 

softwdare testing is the process of analyzing a software item to detect the differecnes between existing and required condition and to evauae the features of the software item 
that is to detect 

Why software testing is important ?

Architectural flaws
Poor design descisions
Invalid or incorrect functionality
security vulnerablities
Scalability issues


SDLC 
Whith the software developemnt life cycle,th process of software design is divided into small parts,which makes the problem more understandable and easier to solve
In SLDC we need to follow the process strictly

Agile :-


SDLC :-
planning 
defining 
designing 
building  
testing
deployment


Stage 1  -Planning  and requirement analysis
In planning phase we deal with market analysis ,It is obtained from requirement analysis , market survey ,

stage 2 - defining Requirement 
My tecnical requirement , are documented .Requirements are confirmed with clients.Documentation is required

Stage 3 - Designing Archtecture
SRS is reference for software designers to come up with the best architecure for the software .Hencde ,with the requirements
defined in SRS, multiple designer for the product architecture are present in the design document spec

staage 4 - Developing product 
   Product is inside development phase

stage 5 - Product testing and Integration

After the development of the product,testers have to make sure that quality og the product is maintained
Documentation training and support is essensial .Because it helps new Joiners to understand the process

stage 6 _- deployment and maintanence of products
Decide whether to deploy in phase or as whle.Ten test in a real enviornment
To test the software in diiferenn URL.To test scalability like how many users can use software at he time .To check every thing and the deploy



Waterfall model :-
It is rigid .With changing requirement in Industry nowdays 


Agile model :-
This model is mainly mode to adapt tpo changing reuirement .The main advantage is to complete project quickly.

Client :---UAT


Iterative model
In Iteratve model ,each cycle result in a semi-development but deployale version
It provides a feedback path 

In iterative model


 Spiral Model 
The Spiral Model is sdlc which provdes 
If any risk is identifies then it is mitigated in the next loop of 
one SDLC is one Loop 
Spiral Model is used in big projects
The exact number of loop are unknown \

//There is also contracts of developing software

4. Increment process model
The increment process model is also known as the Suceessive version model
We create different version of the software 



STLC
The main goal of the STLC is to identify and document any defects or issue in the software aoolication as early as possible in the development process.This allows issue to be addressed and resolved before the software is released to the public
 
# STLC is a funcamental part of the SDLC but STLC consists of only the testing phases

# STLC start as requirements are defind or software

# The test cases should be created as soon as requirement phase is started

 
Requirement analysis  => test Planning => 

Requirement analysis :-
Understanding the requirement 
Meet with clients and understan the requierments
reviewing documentation 

Identiying any ambiguity or inconsistencies in requirements

Identifying any missing or incomplete requiremnets

Identify any potentials for risk 

Test planning 

# Testing objectives ad scope
# Development a test strategy :selecting the testing mthods and techniques that will be used 
#Identifying the expected results for test case
# review and validating the test cases
# Updating the requirements -Lengty test cases
# test cases should be easy to understand
# updating the requiremets for RTM (requirement Test Matrix)


stage 4: Test Enviornment setup 

Stage 5:- Test Case Development

defect log :-

defect retesting :- Any defects that are indentified during test executin are retested to ensure that they have been fixed correctly

The test execution is a repeatative process It cannot be done only once 

Test colsure report :- A report is created that documen all the testing rela

Test enviornment clean up : -
To clean up the data of client from the eviornment

Reports need to be shared with everyone 

Give the KT(Knowledge transfer) to other stakeholders

## ISTQB certification ##

Tesing sows the presence of defects 
Exhaustie t

In which operation your operating system fails ??
=> Multitasking 

principle 2 Defect Clustering 

Defect clustering is the idea that a small number of software 
If yu find one defect in the one module then you can also find defect on other module
Identify the area and focus on it

Principle 3 :- 
Pesticide paradox
Test cases need to be costantl ybe reviewed and revised 
Evolve the test cases
If database testing then do other testing 

principle 4 : Testing shows the presence of defects
It talks about aboutprobability of un founded defects in the program

You should not document that software is bugs free

Principle 5 :-Absence of error - fallacy
If the application is tested for the wrong requirement

principle 6 :- Early Testing 
Early testing - Testing should start as early as possible i the softeware Deveopment


principle 7 :-Testing is context dependent
Test condition and methidologies sould be decded based on the type of the project
eg - POS and ATM testimg is competely different


Test Maturity Model :-

CMM Level - example -(Dabba valla makes no mistakes)
CMM level

1. Five level of TMM
2. RMM vs CMM'
3. Benefits of TMM
4. Need for TMM

# It help in better assesssmeny and enhanceent of quality
#




Level 1 : Initialization 
At this level, we ar able 




level 2 deinion
this is the second level of the Test Maturity Model
This is 

level 3 Integraton 


level 5 : measurement and managemet

level 6 ; optimization
