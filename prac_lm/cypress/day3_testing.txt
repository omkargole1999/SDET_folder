Types of testing 
1. manual testing
# whiite

# black box
=> functional testing
=> non functional t or something testing

grey box

2. Automation testing



### Black box testing

Inthis tecnique,the tster or the QA analyst wil onlt check the functionality
of the particular module or particular method 



type 2 - White Box esting

In theis the person will check the internal structureof the system like designs ,coding ,etc,maually
The development team will reviwe the entire coding part line by line to ensure the correctness

dev envornment is very unstable enviornment
developers use unit testing

type 3 - Grey Box testing

The technique is the combination of both white-box testing and black-box testing.Here ,the internal structure of the application is partially known by the tester

Below are 4 major beased testing.
1. decision table based testing
   a.Cndition stub
   b.Action stubs
   c.Condition entries
   d. 
 condition stub are conditions
 action stub

Type of descision table
1. Limited entry 
2. Extended entry


2. Pairwise testing 
3. cause efffect graphing testing
Ths tecnique in which a graph is used to epresenet the situations of combination input conditions.
minimum test cases and maximum coverage

AND -for effect E! to be true ,both
OR
NOR

always go from right to left(effect to cause)


4. state 


Trchnique 2 :- Pairwise testing 

pairwise testing is a type of software testing in which permutation and cmbnatio method is used to test the software pairwise 

step 1 -
1. Order ctegory
a . Buy
b.sell

Advantage of pairwise testing
1. pairwise testing reduces the number of execution of test cases
2. Pairwise tsting increaes the test coverage alomost up to hundread percentage
3. pairwise


disavantages of pairwise 
1. some of the combination can be missed or cannot be sorted

techniquw 4 - state transition testing
Ti is testing wich is performed to check the change in state of the application under carrying input.

Transition states
1. Change mode
2. Reset:
3. Time set: 
4. When this mode is activated.

state transition diagram
1. states
2. transition
3. event 
4. actions


White Box techniques
1. Data flow tesing
2. control flow testing
3. code coverage
4. statement coverage

advantages of code base
1. dev => key way(same for dev and qa) => plot
2. 



sonar cube :- 
Jtest


Test management tool :-
Eery jia id is issue id


Jira - open 

Task => sub task

In story - create task

functional testing
defination :- Functional testing is type of testing that seeks wsablish wheather each application feature works as oer the softeare requirement

Below are 3 types of functional test
1. unit testing
it focuses on small units of the module
It ensures tha teverything works perfectly

Integration testing 
1. When different moduls are integrated together sometimes the integration is not proper
some thimes the api dont transfer the data

2. Has the API integrated correctly into the system

1. Big - Bang Integration - 
Big bang Integration combies all the small modules and and test thm together

disadvantages
1. There will be quite 


Advantages - 
In bottom-up tsing no stubs are required
A principle advantage of his Integration testing is that 


Mixed integration testing :-
1 . 


env set up => create test cases => create test data => execute test cases
